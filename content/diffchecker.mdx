DiffChecker is a quick and secure tool designed to help you compare file differences in your code. Born from my own struggle to spot AI-made changes in files, this app is built with privacy in mind.

## Features

- **Privacy-Focused:** Your code stays secure – no storage of secret keys, API tokens, or any sensitive information.
- **Fast & Simple:** Compare two sets of code quickly with an intuitive, clean interface.
- **Secure:** No tracking or data collection – all comparisons happen locally in your browser.
- **Accurate Diffing:** Uses a robust diff algorithm to highlight precise changes line by line.

## How It Works

Simply paste your original code and the modified version into the respective fields, then click the **Compare** button. DiffChecker will process your inputs and display the differences clearly, making it easy to identify changes without any risk to your sensitive data.

## Installation

Clone the repository and install the dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/diffchecker.git
cd diffchecker
npm install
# or
pnpm install

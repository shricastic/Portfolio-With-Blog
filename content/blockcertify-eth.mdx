## What is BlockCertify?
BlockCertify is an innovative system that allows admins to dynamically create educational or course completion certificates, storing them securely on both MongoDB and the blockchain. The blockchain ensures immutability, enhancing trust and security.

## Technologies
- **React**
- **Express**
- **Ganache**
- **Truffle**
- **MongoDB**
- **Solidity**
- **JavaScript**

## Key Features
- **Dynamic Certificate Generation:** Admins can create certificates on-demand, ensuring up-to-date information and reducing manual errors.
- **Immutable Records:** Certificates contain the name, course, completion date, PRN, and a unique hashcode.
- **Cost Savings:** Leveraging blockchain reduces the need for physical storage and eliminates the risk of forgery, leading to significant cost savings.
- **Hashcode Verification:** A hashcode generated from the certificate details is printed on the certificate.
- **Verification Portal:** Firms can verify certificates by entering the PRN and hashcode on our portal.

## Why Blockchain?
Blockchain's immutable nature guarantees that once a certificate is created, it cannot be altered. This ensures authenticity, reduces fraud, and simplifies the verification process.

## Additional Benefits
- **Increased Efficiency:** Automating the certificate generation process reduces administrative workload and speeds up issuance.
- **Scalability:** The system can handle large volumes of certificate requests, making it ideal for institutions of any size.
- **Environmental Impact:** Reducing paper use and physical storage contributes to a more sustainable solution.

## How BlockCertify Works
1. **Admin Creates Certificates:** Details are stored in both MongoDB and the blockchain.
2. **Certificate Issued:** Each certificate contains all necessary information, including a unique hashcode.
3. **Verification:** Companies or individuals can verify a certificate via our online portal using the PRN and hashcode.

## Who Can Benefit?
- **Educational Institutions:** Securely issue course completion certificates.
- **Employers:** Easily and reliably verify candidate credentials.
- **Students:** Gain enhanced credibility and trust in their certifications.
